For my final project in my CS prep work, I've created my personal website which I've decided to name "Christina Can Code!"

Here I have created a website linking both CSS and JS files in the HTML code. I've added a header. I've added a couple of photos of myself in the form of a slideshow with two arrows on the sides of the photo. I added a "click" event on the arrows for the user to be able look through the photos. Below that, there is some unordered and ordered text nested with each other, listing my interests. 

I also used some styling to background colors, block color, font styling, and spacing.
